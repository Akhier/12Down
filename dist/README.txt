Hello! Welcome to 12Down, a 7 day roguelike challenge game


Controls are arrow keys, numpad, and some others which you will be told in game as needed


To make the stairs appear you have to kill 10 monsters on a floor though you can stay there as long as you want.

At 5 monsters killed something appears on that level.

No you can't save, the way my game is setup didn't allow me to use shelve and I didn't have time to look into an alternate option.

A text file does get generated when you die or win to note how well you did.

I can gaurentee that it works on windows 7 (on my computer) and there is an .exe for the game. Since it does use python though you can see if you can get it working on linux and mac.

To win you just have to get to the twelth floor and take the stairs down from there. While there isn't a score you can consider that the farther you get with a lower level the better you did.
